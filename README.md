## Notable Projects:

### 1. SwiftUI Frameworks Series (In Progress)

This series explores the creation of custom SwiftUI frameworks. Designed as a showcase of my technical approach
and architectural thinking, each framework demonstrates my ability to craft reusable components using patterns
and system design inspired by Apple‚Äôs framework engineers.

### 2. Space Patrol

**Space Patrol** is a visionOS app designed to demonstrate the potential of FieldKit, a lightweight yet expressive
mathematical framework. FieldKit provides visual representations of various vector fields. Built using the Entity-
Component-System (ECS) architectural pattern, the framework emphasizes modularity and scalability.

### 3. Quotly (Apple's WWDC Swift Student Challenge Winner 2025)

**Quotly** is a project that holds a special place in my heart ‚Äî a passion-driven app designed to cultivate inspiration
and self-awareness in everyday life. Quotly provides users with daily motivational quotes paired with the space
to jot down personal thoughts and reflections.
