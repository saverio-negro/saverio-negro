## Notable Projects:

### 1. SwiftUI Mini-Framework Building Portfolio (Hot)

The following are SwiftUI custom frameworks I have built from the simplest to the most complex. It's just meant to showcase my ability to build meaningful components using similar patterns and design systems used by framework engineers from Apple.

### 2. Space Patrol

"Space Patrol" is a project born with the idea of showcasing a simple mathematical framework I have built for visionOS, which I named "FieldKit". "FieldKit" is meant to offer a visual representation for different types of vector fields¬†‚Äî¬†mainly force vector fields. The framework was built according to the ECS (Entity-Component-System) design pattern and is still in its early stages. "Space Patrol" walks the user through a guided and funny experience in space, and serves as a UI for "FieldKit".
