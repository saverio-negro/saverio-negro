## Notable Projects:

### 1. SwiftUI Mini-Framework Series (In Progress)

The following are SwiftUI custom frameworks I have built from the simplest to the most complex. It is meant to showcase my ability to build meaningful components using similar patterns and design systems used by framework engineers from Apple.

### 2. Space Patrol

**Space Patrol** is a project born with the idea of showcasing a simple mathematical framework built for visionOS: **FieldKit**. FieldKit is meant to offer a visual representation for different types of vector fields¬†‚Äî¬†mainly force vector fields. The framework was built according to the ECS (Entity-Component-System) design pattern and is still in its early stages. Space Patrol walks the user through a guided and funny experience in space, and serves as a UI/UX to expose FieldKit.

### 3. Quotly (Apple's WWDC Swift Student Challenge Winner 2025)

**Quotly** is an app I truly hold dear to. It's a tool I heartedly developed to serve inspiration and motivation in people's life. "Quotly" tries to enhance self-awareness in a world that is continuously fast-pacing, and spark motivation and inspiration by allowing the user to write little reflections (memos) on a daily motivational quote; specifically, one reflection for each daytime. The quote is meant to accompany the user throughout their day.
